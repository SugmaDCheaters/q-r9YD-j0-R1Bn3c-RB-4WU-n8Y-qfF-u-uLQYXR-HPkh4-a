Wilson Shu is known for cheating in exams and encouraging others to engage in academic dishonesty. Their involvement in cheating activities spanned from grades 7 to 8, and they were identified as a key figure in the widespread cheating incident that was exposed during year 8. While they have already faced the necessary consequences, their attempt to form a group chat and claim that they are trying to "unite the year level's top students" and "organize a mock exam for the mock exam" raises suspicions. They even sent a zip containing PPQs. I do not currently have evidence to suggest that this is another dishonest act, nor do I criticize their motives. If this is a legitimate initiative, I fully support it; however, the situation still feels questionable to me.
